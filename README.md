 # 0x11. C - printf
The printf project is a simple implementation of the C standard library function printf. It allows users to format and print data to the console.
The format string is a string of characters that specifies how the data should be formatted when printed to the console. The format string can contain various format specifiers, which are enclosed in % characters. Here are some of the most commonly used format specifiers:

%s: String
%d: Integer
%f: Float
%c: Character
%p: Pointer
The format string can also contain positional arguments, which are specified using the $ character followed by a number. For example, %1$s would refer to the first argument passed to the function, and %2$d would refer to the second argument.
